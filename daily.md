# Daily Scrum
## Purpose definition

---

# Goal of the development team

We stand for **maximizing the value** of our products.

---

# Managing resources

- Limited time

- Limited engineers

- Unexpected external conditions

---

### The Purpose of Daily Scrum is to:

# GET THE BETTER ESTIMATION

To adapt the situation changes quickly,

To stay you focused doing things right,

To help stakeholders making decision.

---

# Rules

- Keep the estimation **up to date**

- **Track your work** for the feedback

- Be ready to **help others**

---

# I promise you

### I won't ask "Can you complete the story on schedule?". Instead:

- Is your estimation up to date?

- What's the problem between the estimation and the reality?

- How can we solve the problem?
